      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

At first, Anakin hadn't felt the same way. But as Obi-Wan helped him prepare for the Trials, the young Padawan found himself strangely charmed by this more passionate side of his master. Was this new version of Obi-Wan the antidote to the darkness threatening to consume Anakin? Or was he just another hypocritical Jedi traitor? Either way, Vader can't forget him.",
      "body": "The black figure gazed at the young man who stood at the end of the narrow beam, gripping the metal spire, closer than ever, but still out of reach. Luke Kenobi was glaring, nostrils flared, not at cauterised remains of his right arm, but at him.\n\n\"I'll never join you,\" said Luke, through gritted teeth.\n\nBehind the rigid mask, a smirk creased his disfigured face. This defiance was familiar and could prove useful. \"If you only knew the power of the dark side,\" he said, through his vocabulator, \"Obi-Wan never told you what happened to your other father.\"\n\nLuke stepped onto the ring at the base of the spire then turned to face him again. \"Obi-Wan was my only father and you killed him.\n\n\"No, I am one of your fathers, your true father.\"\n\n\"No, no.\" Luke's face twisted. His eyes bulged. \"That's not true. That's impossible.\"\n\n\"Search your feelings. You know it to be true.\"\n\nHis son cried out twice more over the howling wind.\n\n\"Luke, you can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is your destiny, just as defeating the Jedi was mine. Do not mourn their loss. They sought to enslave you. I forbade it, but Obi-Wan ignored my wishes. He stole you from me, along with your mother and sister. Now you have returned. Join me and together we will rule the galaxy as father and son.\" He extended a gloved hand. \"Come with me. It is the only way.\"",
